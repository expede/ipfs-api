Seamlessly deploy websites and store secure user data

## QuickStart

### MacOS

```shell
brew install fission-suite/fission/fission-cli
```

Or to build from source:

```shell
# Dependencies
brew install stack
brew install postgresql

# Go to the Fission repo
cd $FISSION_REPO

# Build & install
stack install --no-nix fission-cli:fission

# Build only
stack build --no-nix fission-cli:fission 
```

Once you've built the CLI, it is installed in `~/.local/bin/fission`. If you already have an existing fission key in `~/.ssh`, copy it as follows:

```shell
cp ~/.ssh/fission ~/.config/fission/key/machine_id.ed25519
```

Now run `fission setup` to install the Fission-controlled IPFS node.

### Binary Releases

Grab the latest binary for your operating system from our [release page](https://github.com/fission-suite/fission/releases).

You'll find the most up to date instructions for [installation](https://guide.fission.codes/hosting/installation) and [getting started](https://guide.fission.codes/hosting/getting-started) in our [Guide](https://guide.fission.codes).

If using Linux, install `libpq-dev`

### Seamless Deployments
Deployments are just one step: `fission app publish`


```
$ fission app publish
üöÄ Now live on the network

üìù DNS updated! Check out your site at:

Simple as that!

If you'd like to redeploy everytime you change a file, use `fission app publish --watch`
